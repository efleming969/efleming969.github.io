summary: Even with an emphasis on collaboration in modern software development, I find most teams lack the necessary vulnerabilities to be truly collaborative.

I recently facilitated a private class with a group of software engineers where the topics ranged from test driven development to collective code ownership.  As is typical in my classes, groans of dislike rang out when I covered the topic of pair programming.  It amazes me how this single concept can invoke such disdain and ridicule, even among educated and socially acquainted individuals.

In this post, I look at the roles of vulnerability and shame in software development and how they effect our ability to collaborate in new ways.

## Vulnerability is a measurement of courage

Unfortunately, the negative perception of pair programming is all too common in the software industry and systemic of a larger issue; that developers and more specifically development teams lack the necessary vulnerability to truly engage in a highly collaborative environment.

If you are wondering what I'm talking about then do yourself a favor and spend the next 20 minutes discovering the world of vulnerability and shame, through [Bren√© Brown's TED talk on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV0).  She quite eloquently exclaims that "vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage" which is contrary to popular believe that vulnerability is a sign of weakness.

This cultural misconception can single handedly constrain developers from forming the innovative, creative and adaptable teams we are trying to achieve in modern software development.

## I can do absolutely anything, I'm an expert

One of my favorite videos to show in class is ["The Expert"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg), where a single individual is bombarded with a series of awkward conversations that ultimately leads him to capitulation.  As "experts", we are often held to unachievable expectations which often manifest themselves in the form of shame.

It's this "expectation shame" that I see often and is probably the number one source of the collaborative instability in Agile teams.  Quite simply, developers are afraid of working in close and constant contact due to the expectations that are placed on them and more importantly that they place on themselves, implicit or not.

Developers tend to keep their work last possible moment, even on self proclaimed "Agile" teams.  This "hoarding of work" is probably an attempt to escape ridicule or the embarrassment that comes from unfinished tasks and can be evidence of fear from unmet expections.

Keep in mind that being experts does not mean we are infallible.  Quite the opposite, we should embrace failure and expose ourselves for the humans that we are.  In the immortal words of James Joyce "A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals to discovery".

## Conclusion

In order to achieve highly collaborative environments we need to tear down the walls of shame, open ourselves to vulnerabilities and take a serious look at our expectations.  Only then can we apply the difficult practices of pair programming and collective ownership.
