DevOps is a popular movement around creating, delivering and maintaining software based on patterns and practices from the past several years.  Unfortunately there is a significant amount of confusion in the community about its "true" definition, but the common theme seems to focus on merging typically siloed entities (i.e. development and operations) into cohesive, value producing machines.  Many view it as a culture or philosophy for the software delivery process.

The popularity of the movement has spawned vigorous discussions about how to better incorporate operational concerns into the ever increasing pace of development.  In addition, some amazing tools have been produced to help bridge the gap between these notoriously opposing forces.

While, I see good things coming out of the movement and welcome any disruptions that can help evolve the software industry, I question whether we need a newly branded philosophy or even an alternative culture around how to build software.

Agile, as conveyed in the [manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), has all the necessary components to achieve the same results, while being flexible enough to accommodate new ideas and practices to help with the stated values.

In fact, the manifesto itself and more specially the first [principle](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), states that "Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software."  This has significant overtones around operational concerns and can easily provide the catalyst for solving some of the challenges.  Not coincidentally, a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912) with an appropriate title, published in 2010, looks at this concept and is a must read for any Agile practitioner who strives to deliver valuable software.

However, if we take a serious look at the current state of many of the derived methodologies and more specifically Scrum, we will find that the primary focus has been from the developer's perspective with a slant on building "new" products or features.  It's not surprising to me that DevOps has become so popular and is construed as an opposing philosophy to the Agile movement.  So rather than branding it as a competing philosophy, we should inspect and adapt our processes to enable our teams to incorporate what has been learned.

In summary, I do not see the DevOps movement as "the new Agile" but rather a call to action for organizations to start thinking about the entire delivery pipeline.  On a lighter note, I think we should juxtapose DevOps with Extreme Programming (XP) and allow the teams to converge on a shared set of values provided by the Agile manifesto, leaving us with Extremely Agile DevOps.
