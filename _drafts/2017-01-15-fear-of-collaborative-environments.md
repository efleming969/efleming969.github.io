title: The Fear of Collaborative Environments

summary: Even with an emphasis on collaboration in modern software development, I find most teams lack the necessary vulnerabilities to be truly collaborative.

I often facilitate workshops for groups of software engineers where the topics range from practices like Continuous Integration to Test-Driven Development. One topic, Pair Programming, typically invokes a significant amount of debate and, more often than not, disdain within the group.

This negative perception of Pair Programming is all too common in the software industry and potentially systemic to a larger issue; that developers and more specifically development teams lack the necessary characteristics to engage in highly collaborative environments.

## Vulnerability

Several years ago I watched a TED talk by [Bren√© Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bren%C3%A9_Brown) about the [power of vulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psN1DORYYV). In that talk, she states that "vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage", which is quite contrary to popular believe that vulnerability is a sign of weakness.

If its true the being vulnerable leads to courage, then this misconception can possibly hinder development groups from becoming the innovated and collaborative teams we want them to be.

Many people argue that courage is a core value of building 

I think this misconception of vulnerability, constrains our development groups from becoming the innovative and collaborative teams we want them to be.

In fact, software engineering is often associated with individuals possessing strong opinions and egos with a tendency toward introverted personalities. Whether this true or not, there is definitely a certain stigma attached to the role, and one that potentially creates barriers to a collaborative process.

## The Expert

Another video I share with colleague is ["The Expert"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg), which is funny video highlighting the communication barriers that "technical experts" often face in a work place environment.

where a single individual is bombarded with a series of awkward conversations that ultimately leads him to capitulation.  As "experts", we are often held to unachievable expectations which often manifest themselves in the form of shame.

It's this "expectation shame" that I see often and is probably the number one source of the collaborative instability in Agile teams.  Quite simply, developers are afraid of working in close and constant contact due to the expectations that are placed on them and more importantly that they place on themselves, implicit or not.

Developers tend to keep their work last possible moment, even on self proclaimed "Agile" teams.  This "hoarding of work" is probably an attempt to escape ridicule or the embarrassment that comes from unfinished tasks and can be evidence of fear from unmet expections.

Keep in mind that being experts does not mean we are infallible.  Quite the opposite, we should embrace failure and expose ourselves for the humans that we are.  In the immortal words of James Joyce "A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals to discovery".

## Conclusion

In order to achieve highly collaborative environments we need to tear down the walls of shame, open ourselves to vulnerabilities and take a serious look at our expectations.  Only then can we apply the difficult practices of pair programming and collective ownership.
